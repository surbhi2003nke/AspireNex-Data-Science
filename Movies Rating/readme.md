# **TASK 2 - MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON**

This project demonstrates how to predict the ratings of IMDb India Movies using machine learning models. The dataset used is the IMDb India Movies dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about various movies. The goal is to predict the rating status of movies based on different features.  

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies

## Requirements:  
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## This script will:

- Load the IMDB Movies India dataset.
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features if necessary).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train Linear model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

## View results:  

he script will print evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy score, mean squared error) to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it will visualize predicted vs actual ratings for a subset of the data.

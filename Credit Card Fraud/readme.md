# TASK 5 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION  

This project demonstrates how to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains information about various transactions. The goal is to predict the fraud status of transactions based on different features.  

Data Set: <link> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud  <link>
## Requirements:  
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## This script will:

- Load the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features if necessary).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train Linear model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

## View results:  

The script will print evaluation metrics i.e accuracy_score to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it will visualize predicted vs actual prices for a subset of the data.

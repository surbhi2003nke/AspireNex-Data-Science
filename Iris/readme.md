# **TASK 3 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

This project demonstrates how to classify Iris flowers using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Iris Flower dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about various Iris flower species. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on different features.    

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

## Requirements:  
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## This script will:

- Load the Iris Flower dataset.
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features if necessary).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train Linear model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

## View results:  

The script will print evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy score) to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it will visualize the classification results.
